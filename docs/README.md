# Socketry Libraries Explorer

This is a GitHub Pages website that provides an interactive explorer for the Socketry organization's libraries.

## Files

- `index.html` - The main HTML page with the interactive explorer

The page reads data from the repository root:
- `../.workspace_metadata.json` - Repository metadata including descriptions, dependencies, and timestamps
- `../categories.json` - Category definitions and patterns for organizing repositories

## Features

- **Category Filtering**: Browse repositories by category (async-core, http-web, frameworks, etc.)
- **Search**: Search repositories by name, description, or category
- **Repository Details**: View detailed information including:
  - Description
  - Category
  - Enabled/Disabled status
  - Last pull timestamp
  - Remote push/update timestamps
  - Dependencies on other Socketry libraries

## Updating Data

The JSON files are automatically generated by the socketry_workspace management tool. To update the website:

1. Run the metadata generation command in the workspace
2. The website automatically reads from `.workspace_metadata.json` and `categories.json` in the repository root
3. Commit and push the updated JSON files

## Local Development

To test locally, simply open `index.html` in a web browser. The page uses relative paths to load the JSON files.

## GitHub Pages

This site is published via GitHub Pages from the `docs/` folder on the main branch.
